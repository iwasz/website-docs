Right after powering on the stopwatch is in the main mode (let's call it a stopwatch mode). To cycle through the rest of the available menu options, you press the button briefly (a *short-press* later on throughout the docs). To change the setting, you usually press the button once, but this time a little longer (*long-press* later on). This works for boolean settings like *sound on/off* or *IR on/off*. There are settings that are changed slightly differently, so read on.

* **Stopwatch mode** : in this mode the stopwatch waits for an IR beam, or for external sensors to be connected, and does its usual job of tracking time in case of a trigger event.
  * *Short-press* for the next mode.
* **Results mode** : this mode lets you cycle through up to 64 results that are stored in the flash. In case of flash being empty, you get an *empty* message on the screen. Upon entering this mode, the first result is displayed, or *empty*. To display the second result, you have to *long-press* the button.
  * *Long-press* to display the second result, and enter the *cycling through all results* mode. 
    * *Short-press* to show the third and every consecutive result. 
    * Finally *long-press* to exit the *cycling through all results* mode. 
  * *Short-press* for the next mode.
* **Screen orientation mode** lets you flip the display upside down and right side up again by using a *long-press*.
  * *Long-press* changes the screen orientation.
  * *Short-press* for the next mode.
